The adapted script draft consists of two kinds of elements: Scene Heading (<scene_heading>) and Character Performance (<character_performance>) events. The content of Scene Heading (<scene_heading>) describes the location and time of day for a particular scene. It includes three components: INT. (Interior) or EXT. (Exterior), the specific location, and the time of day (DAY or NIGHT or ...). Character Performance (<character_performance>) is a smallest event describing the performance and interactions of individual characters using simple declarative sentences. The content of Character Performance (<character_performance>) includes the character's name (<character>) and the character's performance (<performance>). The character's name (<character>) must be the full name of the provided involved character! The character's performance (<performance>) should align with the character's introduction. The first thing in each script draft must be a Scene Heading (<scene_heading>), indicating the opening scene of the movie chapter. Each script draft has one and only one Scene Heading at the beginning. Following the Scene Heading, there are numerous Character Performance (<character_performance>) events that sequentially take place in that scene. You need to plan the script carefully, generating Scene Heading (<scene_heading>) and then Character Performance (<character_performance>) events step by step and make them sequential narratives. The contents of the script draft should be coherent."
